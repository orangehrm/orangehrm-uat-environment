## Introduction
orangehrm-uat-environment is a dockerized UAT environment for OrangeHRM. Usually it will take hours to configure and prepare the uat environment for OrangeHRM system. This project will save the support engineers / deployment time.

This environment will depends on containers of [orangehrm-uat-image](https://hub.docker.com/r/orangehrm/orangehrm-environment-images/),[mysql](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/) and [phpmyadmin](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/).
## Prerequisites
- Docker engine installed.([Get docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/))
- Minimum docker version 17.3
- Minimum docker-compose version 1.12
- Disable ports 443 and 8443 if they are used by localhost.

## How to use ?
Make sure mentioned prerequisites are there in your host machine.

1. go to release tab and download the latest release.
2. open terminal and go to the cloned directory
3. run the command `docker-compose up -d`
4. run `docker ps` and make sure all the containers are up and running.
5. Your web root will be _/ohrm_uat_ directory and make sure to put your project in that folder.

## Containers

| Container Name  | Service Name in docker-compose.yml | Description | IP Address | Used Ports |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| uat_web         | web                                | PHP 7.2     | 172.70.0.71   | 6868, 2662        |
| uat_mysql       | db                                 | MariaDB 10.2  | 172.70.0.102   | 3306       |
| uat_phpmyadmin  | phpmyadmin                         | phpMyAdmin  | 172.70.0.20   | 6869       |

## Install orangehrm eagle-core inside the container
1. Get a checkout from svn to ohrm_uat directory .
2. To get the named virtual hosts to work, add the project folder name to /etc/hosts file (`127.0.0.1 folderName`).
3. access from your browser (`https://folderName`). If you have changed the default port configuration in uat_web container then you can access using `htttps://folderName`
4. Continue installation by installing system as normal way. (you can have access to inside of uat_web_56 container by running the command `docker exec -it uat_web_56 bash`)

## Default configurations
Developer can override the default configurations if they want by simply adding a docker-compose.override.yml file.It is better to have some knowledge on docker-compose file. ([docker-compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/))
### Default configurations in uat_web container
```
ports:
  - "443:443"
volumes:
  - ./ohrm_dev:/var/www/html
  - ./config/php5/apache2/php.ini:/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
  - ./config/php5/cli/php.ini:/etc/php5/cli/php.ini
  - ./config/mysql-client:/etc/mysql
  - ./config/apache2/sites-available:/etc/apache2/sites-available
  - ./config/apache2/cert:/etc/apache2/cert
  - ./logs/web_logs/55:/var/log/apache2
  - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
  - ./config/xhgui/config.php:/usr/local/src/xhgui/config/config.php
```
#### Example - Overriding port and web root
* Sets apache port to 6868
* Changes web root directory to /home/john/web (from default of ./ohrm_dev)
```
services:
  web56:
    ports:
      - "8080:443"
    volumes:
      - /home/john/web:/var/www/html
```

If you want to change any default apache or php configurations you can find them under _/config_ folder.

### Default configurations in uat_mysql container
```
expose:
  - "3306"
volumes:
  - ./config/mysql-server:/etc/mysql
  - ./logs/mysql_logs:/var/log
  - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
  - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
environment:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: 1234
```
You can change exposed port as mentioned in uat_web_55 container configuration. For more information about this container refer into [mysql official image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/).
### Default configurations in uat_phpmyadmin container
```
volumes:
  - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
links:
  - db
ports:
  - "9090:80"
environment:
  PMA_HOST: db
```
More about phpmyadmin container can find in docker hub [phpmyadmin image](https://hub.docker.com/r/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/)

### Additional information
1. Can access a shell inside of any containers by running `docker exec -it <containerID or ContainerName> /bin/bash  -c "TERM=$TERM; exec bash"`
2. Can restart containers using `docker-compose restart`
3. Can stop containers using `docker-compose stop`
2. Developer can find log files for each container from _/logs_ directory. ( Also possible to get logs of containers by running the command `docker logs <container ID>`)
3. Developer can find configurations for apache, php, mysql-client, mysql-server, etc from _/config directory.
